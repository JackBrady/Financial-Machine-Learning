# Financial-Machine-Learning
Notebook based on the book "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos Lopez de Prado
## About
This notebook explores many of the concepts presented in the book "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" by Marcos Lopez de Prado. 

I read de Prado's book and created this notebook a while back with the goal being to get a good understanding of how ML was being applied in the financial space and the many domain specific challenges that come along with it.

Additionally, I wanted to put all the code and concepts from the book together into a full project for my own reference as well as for anyone reading the book looking for a helpful resource.

The corresponding code, data, and list of features are provided in the repo and also linked to in the notebook.
